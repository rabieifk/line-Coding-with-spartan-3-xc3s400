# line-Coding-with-spartan-3-xc3s400
how to use spartan 3 xc3s400 FPGA to decode digital line
In this project line coding is done with spartan 3 familiy a xc3s400 and the code uses FIFO for storing data

The rate of the data is 8000 byte per second. 

The HDLC packet is provided by FPGA and send to high level for processing.
